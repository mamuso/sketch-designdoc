# Sketch Design Doc :chicken::dog:
This plugin exports a simple website using a bunch of conventions and a Sketch document as the structure. We named the plugin "design doc" because initially, we used it to export a design guideline, but we have been using it for many other things.

If you want to see an example, you can build [this website](http://mamuso.github.io/sketch-designdoc/Chicken/Chicken/) using this [Sketch file](https://github.com/mamuso/sketch-designdoc/raw/master/examples/Chicken/Chicken.sketch) as a base.

## How to Install
1. Download and open [```sketch-designdoc-master.zip```](https://github.com/mamuso/sketch-designdoc/archive/master.zip)
2. Open ```DesignDoc.sketchplugin```
3. Done! :dancer:

## How it works
The plugin scans the document and builds a page following these rules:

### Pages 👉 Menu
The order of the pages in the panel is the order of the menu. The plugin generates a ```index.html``` page that redirects to the first element of the menu.

- The plugin ignores the ```Symbols``` page.
- If the name of the page starts with an underscore ```_```, the plugin ignores the page.
- ```_Settings``` is a special case.

### Artboards 👉 Web Page Structure
The order of the artboards in the panel defines the order of the content on the web page. 

- If the name of the artboard starts with an underscore ```_```, the plugin doesn't generate a title for the section nor an entry on the menu.
- If the name of the artboard starts with a slash ```/```, the plugin indents one level the content on the menu and generates a lighter header for the content.

### Artboard Text
Each artboard can have a text description associated. Create a text layer and name it ```[name-of-the-artboard].md```. Use Markdown to format the output. The plugin will ignore the style applied to the layer.

### Preface
Creating a text layer named ```_Preface.md``` in a page, will render as an introduction at web page level. This text layer supports Markdown too.

### Settings
Customize the logo of the output, the color of the menu and the color of the links in the page ```_Settings``` if needed. This page is not mandatory.

- Customize the logo adding an artboard with the name ```_logo```. If the artboard is not present, the output will not have a logo.
- Customize the color of the menu using a vector layer with the name ```_primary```.
- Customize the color of the links using a vector layer with the name ```_secondary```
